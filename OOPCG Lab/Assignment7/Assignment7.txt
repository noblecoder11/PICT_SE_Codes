So how can we reach this elusive goal that cannot be attained by a direct
route? My studies of the past quarter-century have convinced me that there is a
way. It is a circuitous path that begins with achieving control over the contents of
our consciousness.
Our perceptions about our lives are the outcome of many forces that shape
experience, each having an impact on whether we feel good or bad. Most of
these forces are outside our control. There is not much we can do about our
looks, our temperament, or our constitution. We cannot decide—at least so far—
how tall we will grow, how smart we will get. We can choose neither parents nor
time of birth, and it is not in your power or mine to decide whether there will be
a war or a depression. The instructions contained in our genes, the pull of
gravity, the pollen in the air, the historical period into which we are born—these
and innumerable other conditions determine what we see, how we feel, what we
do. It is not surprising that we should believe that our fate is primarily ordained
by outside agencies.
